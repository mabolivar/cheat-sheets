## Context
For the development of high impact projects, it is important to define the minimum steps required for building a successful and impactful capability.

The following checklist presents what needs to be done for releasing new capabilities and aims to guarantee good product quality and an understanding of its business impact. For every project, the following checklist should be completed. 
## Checklist

* Build PID document (include engineers, analysts, and product managers)
   * Estimate the potential impact of the project
* Share PID with the list of reviewers and stakeholders to get product feedback
* Verify that the RFC was shared with the Engineering team before starting the implementation
* Build report(s) to track new capability before rollout
   * Business impact metrics
   * Feature behaviour metrics (is it working as expected?)
* Plan the rollout, align with stakeholders, and define the points of contact (POCs)
* Build training material for LiveOps agents (if required)
* Do Quality Control checks to quickly identify potential issues and fix them before global rollout (e.g. Test cases)
* Define a monitoring process - Add a set of alarms to the most important feature and business metrics (each alarm should trigger an action)
	   * City Level
	   * Store level (if required)
   * Define a process for improvement and maintenance (e.g. parameter tuning)
   * Document capability in the team’s Confluence page
   * Build a summary of the capability’s impact and share it with stakeholders (some weeks after the rollout).

The elements of the checklist suggest the minimum steps to complete for releasing high impact capabilities. Nevertheless, we should think about how to complete these steps in the more efficient possible way.
