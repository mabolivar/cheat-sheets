## Robust

Robust optimization is an important subfield of optimization that deals with uncertainty in the data of optimization problems. Under this framework, the objective and constraint functions are only assumed to belong to certain sets in function space (the so-called “uncertainty sets”). The goal is to make a decision that is feasible no matter what the constraints turn out to be, and optimal for the worst-case objective function.

Two types of uncertainty sets: polytopic and ellipsoidal.
